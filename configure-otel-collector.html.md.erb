This topic describes how you can use configure [System Logging](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/6.0/tas-for-vms/config-sys-logs.html) and the [OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/6.0/tas-for-vms/opentelemetry.html) for App Metrics

1. In Tanzu Ops Manager, and navigate to the TAS for VMs tile.
1. In the **Settings** tab, go to the **System Logging** pane.

For logging, follow these steps to configure an aggregate syslog drain destination in VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs):
1. Configure the aggregate syslog drain URL by clicking the **Add** button next to **Aggregate syslog drain destinations**.
    1. Set the Syslog Drain URL to `syslog-tls://log-store.service.internal:50015`.

    1. For the Certificate Authority:
      1. Enter the [Root CA from Tanzu Operations Manger](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-managing-certificates.html#retrieve-the-tanzu-operations-manager-root-ca-2)
    1. For the Client Certificate:
       1. The Certificate PEM can be obtained from the App Metrics tile
          1. Go to the App Metrics tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager.
          1. Select the **Credentials** Tab
          1. Select the Link to Credential for Syslog Provider Mtls `cert_pem`.
          1. Paste the `cert_pem` for the Certificate PEM
       1. The Private Key PEM can be obtained from the App Metrics tile
          1. Go to the App Metrics tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager.
          1. Select the **Credentials** Tab
          1. Select the Link to Credential for Syslog Provider Mtls `cert_pem`.
          1. Paste the `private_key_pem` for the Certificate PEM
          1. Navigate to the "App Metrics" tile on the Tanzu Ops Manager.

For metrics, follow these steps Otel metrics collection in VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs):
1. Configure Otel by entering the following into **OpenTelemetry Collector Metric Exporters (beta)**.
```
otlp:
  endpoint: dns:metric-store.service.internal:6062
  tls:
    ca_pem: < Ops Manager Root CA >
    cert_pem: < Otel Provider Mtls cert_pem >
    key_pem: < Otel Provider Mtls private_key_pem>
```
  1. For the Certificate Authority:
  1. Enter the [Root CA from Tanzu Operations Manger](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-managing-certificates.html#retrieve-the-tanzu-operations-manager-root-ca-2)
  1. The Certificate PEM can be obtained from the Metric Store tile
    1. Go to the Metric Store tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager.
    1. Select the **Credentials** Tab
    1. Select the Link to Credential for Otel Provider Mtls `cert_pem`.
    1. Paste the `cert_pem` for the Certificate PEM
  1. The Key PEM can be obtained from the Metric Store tile
    1. Go to the Metric Store tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager.
    1. Select the **Credentials** Tab
    1. Select the Link to Credential for Otel Provider Mtls `cert_pem`.
    1. Paste the `private_key_pem` for the Certificate PEM
1. Click **Save** to persist the configuration.
1. Changes to the TAS for VMs tile must be applied before App Metrics and Metric Store can be used without the firehose.
    2. See [Managing certificates with the Tanzu Operations Manager API](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-managing-certificates.html) to obtain value of Certificate Authority for the Client Certificate.
    3. For the Client Certificate:
       1. Go to the **App Metrics** tile on the Tanzu Operations Manager.
       2. Click the provided link for Syslog Provider Mtls Credential to obtain the `cert_pem`.
    4. For the RSA Private Key:
        1. Navigate to the "App Metrics" tile on the Tanzu Ops Manager.
        2. Click the provided link for Syslog Provider Mtls Credential to obtain the `private_key_pem`.
2. Click **Save** to persist the configuration.
3. Restart the Tanzu Operations Manager to apply the changes.
