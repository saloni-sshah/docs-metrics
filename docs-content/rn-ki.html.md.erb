## <a id='130'></a>v1.4.0

**Release Date: June 15, 2017**

### <a id="notes"></a>Notes

The following list describes what's new in PCF Metrics v1.4.0:

* **Reduced Log Loss During Upgrades**: PCF Metrics uses a temporary datastore during Elasticsearch downtime, including upgrades, to significantly reduce log loss by continuing to store app logs from the Loggregator Firehose. The temporary datastore is a new Redis component deployed with PCF Metrics that operators must size according to the needs of their system. This includes a new **Redis Queue Limit** field in the **Data Store** pane of the tile **Settings** tab. See [Configuring the Temporary Datastore](./sizing.html#temp-datastore) for more information.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are upgrading from v1.2, <strong>Redis Queue Limit</strong> is a required field even though PCF Metrics will not use the temporary datastore. PCF Metrics only uses the temporary datastore when upgrading from v1.3 or later.</p>
* **The Trace Explorer**: PCF Metrics provides an interactive graph that allows you to trace requests as they flow through your apps and their endpoints, along with the corresponding logs. See the [Trace App Requests](./using.html#trace) section of _Monitoring and Troubleshooting Apps with PCF Metrics_.
* **Improved UI**: PCF Metrics v1.4.0 includes several UI enhancements such as a new time selector and an improved UX for collapsing and expanding which views you are interested in. To view the UI and understand the new functionality, see [Monitoring and Troubleshooting Apps with PCF Metrics](./using.html).
* **Events**: The **Events** graph now includes the following events:
	* **SSH**: This event corresponds to someone successfully using SSH to access a container that runs an instance of the app.
	* **STG Fail**: This event corresponds to your app failing to stage in PCF.

### <a id="issues"></a>Known Issues

The following sections describe the known issues in PCF Metrics v1.4.0

#### Compatibility with Elastic Runtime

PCF Metrics v1.4.x requires Elastic Runtime v1.8.9 or later.

#### Metrics and Log Loss when Upgrading from v1.3 to v1.4

The upgrade process from v1.3 to v1.4 acts in the following sequence:

1. Removes the data storage components of v1.3
1. Deploys v1.4 data storage and ingestion components

The upgrade process does not save any v1.3 data and the new components do not begin ingesting and storing log or metrics data until they successfully deploy.

#### Smoke Test Failure

The PCF Metrics **Smoke Test** errand may fail if your deployment authenticates user sign-ons with an external SAML identity provider or an external LDAP server. In some cases, these external user stores have an additional login procedure that prevents the errand from authenticating with the deployment and validating against the Metrics API.

If you experience this issue, disable the **Smoke Test** errand in the PCF Metrics tile and click **Apply Changes** to run the install again.

See the [Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/config-er-vmware.html#er-auth-config) section of _Configuring Elastic Runtime_ for more information on what configurations can lead to this failure.

#### For Operators who Deploy PCF Metrics using BOSH

If both of the following are true, you may experience issues while using PCF Metrics:

* You deploy PCF Metrics using BOSH instead of using the PCF Metrics tile in Ops Manager.
* You use self-signed certificates.

Pivotal recommends using certificates issued by a Certificate Authority for BOSH deployments of this product.
