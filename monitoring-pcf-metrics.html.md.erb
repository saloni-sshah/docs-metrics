This topic explains how to monitor the health of the App Metrics service using the logs, metrics,
and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) emitted by Tanzu Application Service and the App Metrics application itself.

For more information about monitoring TAS for VMs,
see [Monitoring TAS for VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/index.html).

## <a id="healthwatch"></a>Healthwatch

The premier way to monitor App Metrics is using [Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/installing.html).
Once installed, navigate to the JobHealth dashboard to view the App Metrics deployment which is named `appMetrics`.

Healthwatch also supports [alerting](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/api/alerts.html) based on VM persistent
disk percentage `system.disk.persistent.percent` and VM health `system.healthy`.

## <a id="appmetrics"></a>App Metrics

App Metrics dashboard for the app metrics application also displays its the platform indicators as custom metrics. 
App Metrics also supports [alerting](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/api/alerts.html) based on dashboard indicators.

## <a id="kpi"></a>Key Performance Indicators

KPIs for App Metrics are the metrics that operators find most useful for monitoring their App Metrics service.
KPIs are high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging issues.

VMware provides the following KPIs as general alerting and response guidance for typical App Metrics installations.
VMware recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their installation by observing historical trends.
VMware also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, installation-specific monitoring metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their own installations.

### <a id="bosh-metrics"></a> BOSH Metrics

All BOSH-deployed components generate the following metrics.
Monitor them to ensure that they are not consuming excess resources.
<table>
   <tr><th colspan="3" style="text-align: center;"><br> Log Store VMs (log-store-vms) <br><br></th></tr>

         The disk filling up will prevent further customization of dashboards and monitors and will prevent new alert triggers from being displayed on metrics graphs.

### <a id="application-metrics"></a> Application Metrics

All applications pushed using Cloud Foundry automatically emit the following application metrics.
App Metrics is a single application and thus can be monitored by App Metrics or another application monitoring services.
The following KPIs can indicate problems with App Metrics and are useful for monitoring any application.
Non-routed applications will return no data or all zeros for Latency, Errors and Traffic metrics.
