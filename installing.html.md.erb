This document describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics.

For information about the components deployed as part of this install procedure, see the [PCF Metrics Product Architecture](./architecture.html) topic.

## <a id='pre-reqs'></a>Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have installed the [Elastic Runtime Tile](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).
* Ensure that you have installed v1.6 or later of the [Redis tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-6/).
* If you are running PCF on AWS, then ensure that, in Elastic Runtime, you have changed the <strong>Loggregator Port</strong> to `4443`from its value of `443`.
* If you are running PCF on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), then do the following to configure the DNS entries to 
accommodate web sockets:
   1. Log in to the GCP console.
   2. In the menu, navigate to the **Networking** tab and click **Load Balancing**.
   3. Find the load balancer that corresponds to `ENVIRONMENT-cf-ws`.
   4. Record the IP address.
   5. Click **Cloud DNS**, then click **ENVIRONMENT-zone**.
   6. Click **Add Record Set**.
   7. Enter a DNS name for mysql-logqueue. The DNS name should be `mysql-logqueue.SYSTEM_DOMAIN`.  Refer to your ERT Tile's configuration of the System Domain under the Domains configuration section.
   8. In the IPv4 address field, enter the IP address of the load balancer that you recorded in Step 4.
   9. Leave the other fields as default.
   10. Repeat Steps 6–9 twice to create DNS records for elasticsearch-logqueue (`elasticsearch-logqueue.SYSTEM_DOMAIN`) and metrics (`metrics.SYSTEM_DOMAIN`).
   
## <a id='step1'></a> Step 1: Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager
   <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: PCF Metrics should be installed on the same network as the Elastic Runtime Tile. </p>

1. Download the PCF Metrics file from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-metrics).
1. Upload the PCF Metrics file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Metrics to your **Installation Dashboard**.

## <a id='step2'></a>Step 2: Configure the PCF Metrics Tile

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following procedures offer a standard configuration. To customize PCF Metrics for high capacity, see the <a href="sizing.html">Sizing PCF Metrics For Your System</a> topic.</p>

From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Metrics** tile.

### Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
1. Click **Save**.


### <a name="alerts"></a> MySQL Alerts

1. Click **MySQL Alerts**.
1. Set the **Email** value. Alerts for issues storing metrics into the MySQL cluster will be sent to this email address.

### <a name="data"></a> Data Store

1. Click **Data Store**.
1. Review the **Elastic Search Heap Size** value. Elastic Search memory allocation for Heap use. Set to 50% of the memory allocated to the smallest of the Elasticsearch instances in Resource Config or 31GB, whichever is smaller. Use a unit of M for megabytes or G for gigabytes.
1. Review the **MySQL InnoDB Buffer Size** value. Set to 80% of MySQL Server VM memory. Use a unit of M for megabytes or G for gigabytes.
1. Review the **MySQL Logqueue Count** value. You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound metrics traffic. 
1. Review the **Elasticsearch Logqueue Count** value. You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of inbound log traffic. 
1. Review the **Ingestor Count** value. You can increase this instance count at any time to accommodate higher levels of Loggregator Firehose traffic. 
1. For **Redis Queue Limit**, calculate the value to enter using the procedure in [Configuring the Temporary Datastore](./sizing.html#temp-datastore). 
    <P class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are upgrading from v1.2, this is a required field even though PCF Metrics will not use the temporary datastore. PCF Metrics only uses the upgrade datastore when upgrading from v1.3 or later.</P>
1. Click **Save**.

### <a name="errands"></a> Errands

1. Click **Errands**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PCF Metrics tile selects all <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong> by default. Pivotal recommends that you do not deselect any errands as doing so can cause issues with the deployment of the tile. However, you can deselect the <b>Remove Legacy PCF Metrics CF Resources</b> errand after deploying v1.3 of the tile.</p>
1. Review the **Post-Deploy Errands** and **Pre-Delete Errands**:
  * If this is the first deployment of the tile, all **Post-Deploy Errands** must be selected.
  * If you deselect the **Remove PCF Metrics 1.3 CF Resources** checkbox, artifacts may remain after the PCF Metrics tile uninstalls.
  * The following list describes what the **Smoke tests** errand does. See the [Smoke Test Errors](./troubleshooting.html#smoke-test) section of the _Troubleshooting PCF Metrics_ topic for information on resolving errors discovered by this errand.
      * Confirms that MySQL ingests metrics
      * Confirms that Elasticsearch ingests logs
      * Confirms that the APIs return metrics and logs

### Resource Config

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job. If you expect a high level of use, you may need to increase the disk resources available to your instances. 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There have been issues with the Ops Manager Bosh Director correctly partitioning persistent disks larger than 2TB.</p>
1. Click **Save**.

### Stemcell

1. Navigate to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and click **Stemcells**.
1. Download the appropriate stemcell version for your IaaS.
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> On AWS make sure to use a HVM stemcell if you are using the default instance sizes.</p>
1. Click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded.

## <a id='step3'></a>Step 3: Deploy PCF Metrics

Click **Apply Changes** to install the service. If the smoke tests fail, see the [Troubleshoot Smoke Test Errors](./troubleshooting.html#smoke-test) section of the _Troubleshooting PCF Metrics_ topic.

Review the [Monitoring and Troubleshooting Apps with PCF Metrics](./using.html) topic for more information on how to log in, use, and interpret data from PCF Metrics.
