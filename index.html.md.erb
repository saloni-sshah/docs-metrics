##<a id='log-store'></a> About the Log Store

App Metrics packages Log Store to provide a persistent storage layer for logs sent through the Loggregator subsystem.
It is multi-tenant aware, is easy to query, and has a powerful storage engine.

- **Multi-tenant aware** Using the auth proxy to ensure Application Developers have access only to their own logs.
- **Ubiquitous Query Language** Log Store uses PromQL-style label selector query for filtering logs.
- **Powerful Storage Engine** The [InfluxDB storage engine](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb) has built-in compression and a memory-efficient series index.

Log Store offers multi-node deployments, data replication, and load balancing in a highly-available configuration.
